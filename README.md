# No-Project

This project was generated with [Angular CLI] v12 and then updgraded to v14. It's only for experimenting and learning purpose.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. 
The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Production deployment

Run `ng build` and then execute 'deployment/deploy.sh' script. 
This will deploy the build to 'https://akshaynile.pythonanywhere.com/no-project'.


## CI-CD pipeline

For each push and pull_request events to master branch will trigger build-test-deploy job on GitHub Actions.
So just sit relax and focus on development work only.
