# No-Project

This project was generated with Angular-CLI v12 and then updgraded to v14.<br> 
It's only for experimenting and learning purpose.<br>

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.<br> 
The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.<br>

## Production deployment

Run `ng build` and then execute `deployment/deploy.sh` script.<br>
This will deploy the build to and can be verified [`akshaynile.pythonanywhere.com/no-project`](https://akshaynile.pythonanywhere.com/no-project).<br>


## CI-CD pipeline

Each push or pull_request events on the master branch will trigger build-test-deploy job on GitHub Actions for that commit.<br>
So just sit relaxed and focus on development work only.<br>
